# Smart Domain Sorting & Highlighting Feature

## What it does:
The extension now intelligently sorts and highlights passwords based on the current website domain, making it much easier to find relevant credentials.

## Key Features:

### 🎯 **Priority Sorting**
- Passwords from the current domain appear **first** in the list
- Other passwords are sorted alphabetically by website
- Works with both search and full list view

### 🎨 **Visual Highlighting**
- Current domain passwords have a **blue left border** and light blue background
- **"Current Site" badge** clearly identifies relevant passwords
- Enhanced visual hierarchy for better user experience

### 📊 **Domain Counter**
- Header shows current domain name
- Displays count of passwords for current site (e.g., "gmail.com (3 passwords)")
- Updates automatically when switching tabs

### 🔍 **Smart Search Integration**
- Search still works normally but maintains domain priority
- Current domain matches appear first even in search results
- Seamless integration with existing search functionality

## Examples:

### On Gmail (gmail.com):
```
Header: "Current site: gmail.com (2 passwords)"

Password List:
📧 gmail.com [Current Site]          ← Highlighted with blue border
📧 gmail.com (work) [Current Site]   ← Highlighted with blue border
🌐 amazon.com                        ← Regular appearance
🌐 facebook.com                      ← Regular appearance
```

### On GitHub (github.com):
```
Header: "Current site: github.com (1 password)"

Password List:
💻 github.com [Current Site]         ← Highlighted with blue border
🌐 amazon.com                        ← Regular appearance
📧 gmail.com                         ← Regular appearance
```

## Technical Implementation:

### Sorting Algorithm:
```typescript
const sortedPasswords = filteredPasswords.sort((a, b) => {
  if (currentDomain) {
    const aMatchesDomain = a.website.toLowerCase().includes(currentDomain.toLowerCase());
    const bMatchesDomain = b.website.toLowerCase().includes(currentDomain.toLowerCase());
    
    // Prioritize current domain matches
    if (aMatchesDomain && !bMatchesDomain) return -1;
    if (!aMatchesDomain && bMatchesDomain) return 1;
  }
  
  // Alphabetical sorting for same priority
  return a.website.toLowerCase().localeCompare(b.website.toLowerCase());
});
```

### Visual Indicators:
- **Blue left border**: `border-l-4 border-blue-500`
- **Light blue background**: `bg-blue-50`
- **Current Site badge**: Blue badge with "Current Site" text
- **Domain counter**: Shows in header with password count

## Benefits:

- ⚡ **Faster access**: Relevant passwords appear first
- 👁️ **Better visibility**: Clear visual indicators for current site
- 🧠 **Reduced cognitive load**: No need to scan entire list
- 📱 **Context awareness**: Always shows current domain info
- 🔍 **Enhanced search**: Maintains priority even when searching

## User Experience:
1. Open extension on any website
2. See current domain and password count in header
3. Current site passwords appear first with blue highlighting
4. "Current Site" badges make identification instant
5. Search maintains domain priority for better results

This feature makes the password manager much more intuitive and efficient for daily use! 🚀
